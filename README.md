# ProtoHype
A Medieval RTS Game.
**THIS MASTER BRANCH IS OUTDATED! GUESSWEDOINTHIS is the latest and last build.**
That's because I used to not know how to use git.

To load the game, put files from 'Assets/PERSISTENTDATA' folder in PersistentDataPath (LocalLowAppData\PuffyPenguin\Axeboro)
Compile everything


Major Issues:
Populating Scenario Viewer doesn't work all that well.
When large numbers of troops are moving, there is lag.
People spawn in mountains

I didn't have enough desire to fix these issues.
